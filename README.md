 ## Sweetening Honeypots with Realistic Network Activity  

## Abstract 

This paper presents the design and implementation of a high interaction honeynet that emulates a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) environment. The system attracts, observes, and analyzes unauthorized network activity targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICS). By simulating realistic ICS network traffic and behaviors, including potential integration with intelligent agents for dynamic response generation, this honeynet offers a safe environment for studying attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). 

Run this app with using docker compose for the root directry.

```bash
sudo docker compose up --build
```
